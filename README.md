# Java Poker
Usage: `java -jar Poker.jar`

## Description
This project was the final project of the course COP3252, Advanced Java Programming taken in the 2022 summer semester at Florida State University. Although this final project was a group project, I opted to tackle it alone and received high marks on it. The main driver of the program, Poker.java, utilizes Java Swing and .awt libraries to deliver the user interface. As of now, it is only a singple-player game where the human player plays against an AI. A BorderLayout was used: displaying CPU information in the North Panel, buttons and sliders in the south, and the game itself in the center.

## Misc.
Rule Set: Texas Holdem
To use the interface, simply click on the buttons provided in the South Panel.
Extra information is provided in the command line as the game plays.
